# Project Todos

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **TypeScript Build Fix** - *completed*
   - Fixed TypeScript error in semantic search result mapping
   - Added explicit type annotation for result parameter: `(result: any) => result.image`
   - Build now passes without errors
   - Deployed successfully as version 65

2. **Semantic Search API Fix** - *completed*
   - Fixed 502 Bad Gateway error in semantic search API
   - Converted ES6 imports to CommonJS for Netlify Functions compatibility
   - Added openai dependency to package.json
   - Converted to .cjs format with proper Netlify Functions syntax (exports.handler)
   - Resolved persistent UTF-8 encoding issues by switching from .cjs to .js format
   - Fixed "Unexpected character 'ï¿½'" build errors that were preventing deployment
   - Fixed data structure mismatch causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'text')" error
   - API now returns proper content.text format expected by React components
   - Function loads correctly and integrates with streaming search UI
   - Uses OpenAI environment variable that's already configured and working
   - Successfully deployed as version 69 with full functionality

3. **Semantic Search Implementation** - *completed*
   - Created semantic search API endpoint using OpenAI embeddings
   - Integrated semantic search into React search flow
   - Implemented progressive streaming of search results
   - Added fallback to keyword search for better coverage

4. **Search UI Enhancement** - *completed*
   - Implemented Sitecore Search style with streaming results
   - Added mixed content types (text, images, AI responses)
   - Progressive loading with simulated network delays
   - Rich card-based UI matching Sitecore design patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- Project successfully deployed at: https://same-ytnix1w67bi-latest.netlify.app
- Semantic search working with OpenAI embeddings
- TypeScript build errors resolved
- All major functionality operational

## âœ… All Core Functionality Complete
**Semantic Search with OpenAI Embeddings** - *fully operational*
- Semantic search API successfully deployed and working
- OpenAI API key already configured and functional
- Real-time embedding computation and cosine similarity ranking
- Proper integration with React streaming search UI
- No manual setup required - everything is working out of the box

## ðŸ”„ Potential Future Enhancements
- Optimize embedding computation and caching
- Add more content to semantic search database
- Improve linter compliance (currently 45 style warnings)
- Real backend integration for production use
- Enhanced UI animations and interactions
