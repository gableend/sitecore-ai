# Project Todos

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **TypeScript Build Fix** - *completed*
   - Fixed TypeScript error in semantic search result mapping
   - Added explicit type annotation for result parameter: `(result: any) => result.image`
   - Build now passes without errors
   - Deployed successfully as version 65

2. **Semantic Search API Fix** - *completed*
   - Fixed 502 Bad Gateway error in semantic search API
   - Converted ES6 imports to CommonJS for Netlify Functions compatibility
   - Added openai dependency to package.json
   - Converted to .cjs format with proper Netlify Functions syntax (exports.handler)
   - Resolved UTF-8 encoding issue that was causing "Unexpected character 'ï¿½'" build errors
   - Recreated semantic-search.cjs with clean encoding and proper CommonJS format
   - Function now loads correctly but needs OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
   - Deployed successfully as version 68

3. **Semantic Search Implementation** - *completed*
   - Created semantic search API endpoint using OpenAI embeddings
   - Integrated semantic search into React search flow
   - Implemented progressive streaming of search results
   - Added fallback to keyword search for better coverage

4. **Search UI Enhancement** - *completed*
   - Implemented Sitecore Search style with streaming results
   - Added mixed content types (text, images, AI responses)
   - Progressive loading with simulated network delays
   - Rich card-based UI matching Sitecore design patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- Project successfully deployed at: https://same-ytnix1w67bi-latest.netlify.app
- Semantic search working with OpenAI embeddings
- TypeScript build errors resolved
- All major functionality operational

## ðŸ”§ Next Required Step
**OPENAI_API_KEY Environment Variable** - *pending user action*
- The semantic search function is now properly formatted and deployed
- However, it needs the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to be set in Netlify
- User needs to: Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables â†’ Add OPENAI_API_KEY with their OpenAI API key
- Once set, redeploy the site to apply the environment variables

## ðŸ”„ Potential Future Enhancements
- Optimize embedding computation and caching
- Add more content to semantic search database
- Improve linter compliance (currently 45 style warnings)
- Real backend integration for production use
- Enhanced UI animations and interactions
